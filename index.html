                            <h4><i class="fas fa-flask"></i> Science</h4> 
                            <p>The game is called Ice Flows - because it does! Ice behaves like a fluid and flows due to gravity, much like a blob of treacle does, though a bit slower…   
                            Snow falls on the top of the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>, and ice is lost at the edges and underneath through <a href="#icebergs">iceberg</a> calving & melting. </p>
                            <p>If the inputs and outputs are equal, the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a> finds a balance – a “happy place” (or more scientifically, an equilibrium state), where the ice flows at a rate to balance these inputs and outputs.</p>
                            <p>The game is based on a simple ice sheet model which represents the way in which ice flows, and how that flow is altered by changes in the surrounding environment.  Computer-based ice sheet simulation models are used by scientists to both understand how the ice behaves and to make projections for future behaviour.</p>      
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-6 border-left">
                            <h4><i class="fas fa-magic"></i> Fiction</h4>
                            <p>Ice flows slowly, from a few metres per year, to several metres per day.  In the game, time and space are modified to make the game playable.</p> 
                            <p>The game would take a very long time to play if we didn’t speed up time, the game time for one level represents thousands of years, though changes in <a href="#icesheets">ice sheets</a> over decades can cause a significant contribution to <a href="#sealevel">sea level</a> change.</p>  
                            <p>If the height and length of the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a> were representative of the real <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>, you would need to line up a few hundred phones in order to see the whole <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>.  Hence, the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>  has been stretched in height in comparison to its length.  Each profile represents about 1500 kilometres in length, and about 4000 metres in height.</p>
                            <h5>Ice flow:</h5>
                            <p>Ice sheet models are very complex mathematical representations of ice flow, and are too complex to be programmed into a game people can play on a mobile phone.  We have simplified the representation of ice flow to produce something that replicates the overall behaviour, but runs quickly on a phone.  As a result, we have not attached any numbers to the sliders for the ocean temperature and snowfall as we don’t want people to think that this is producing any kind of projection for the future.  It is merely there to demonstrate how an <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a> works, and how it responds to changes in its environment.</p>
                            <p>We discuss our representation of ice flow on the blog: <a href="http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/iceflowsgame/2016/05/07/how-ice-flows/">http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/iceflowsgame/2016/05/07/how-ice-flows/</a></p>

                            <p>Ice sheets build up over long periods of time, as snow falls and is compacted under the weight of snow 
                              falling on top.  The compacted snow becomes ice and begins to flow.  We can see the layers of ice building 
                              up in data from radar measurements.  The deformation of these layers can tell us a lot about the ice sheet's 
                              behaviour.<p>
                            <h5>Types of ice sheet:</h5>
                            <p>Ice sheets grow on land and flow towards their coastal margins.  If they are thick enough, the ice can ground in the water.  An ice sheet whose base is above sea level is a terrestrial ice sheet; one with its base below sea level (still in contact with the bedrock) is called a marine ice sheet. A marine ice sheet is susceptible to changes in the ocean temperature as well as changes in air temperature. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is a mainly marine ice sheet, so is very vulnerable to small changes in ocean temperature.</p>
                            <h5>Marine Ice Sheet Instability Hypothesis</h5>
                            Often the bedrock on which a marine ice sheet rests deepens inland, this is called a “reverse” or “retrograde” slope.  An ice sheet which has this type of bed is vulnerable to the “Marine Ice Sheet Instability Hypothesis” where a small change in ocean temperatures may lead to a very large response from the ice sheet.  Some studies have suggested that an ice sheet can never be in a steady state on a reverse slope, once the ice sheet reaches a reverse slope, retreat cannot be reversed.</p>
                            <p>Some studies disagree with this, however, suggesting that the presence of an <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a> may help to stabilise a marine ice sheet on a reverse slope.</p>
                            <p>Also, there are a number of other ways in which the effects may be offset, through an increase in snowfall, through internal variations in flow speed, or by a process where the bedrock “rebounds” due to the reduction in weight, reducing the slope.</p>  
                        </div>

                            <h4><i class="fas fa-magic"></i> Fiction</h4>                              
                            <p>In our ice flow model, we represent the ice sheet as “blocks” which flow and stretch and melt as they flow.  In reality, an ice sheet is a single entity, rather than a set of blocks.  We have to consider the ice as blocks in order to solve the equations for ice flow over space.</p>
                            <p>The ice is represented in the game with a layered texture.  This is to represent what a radar “sees” as it looks at the ice.</p> 
                            The radar is able to see through the ice, picking up changes in the properties of the ice it is travelling through.  The layers represent changes in the make up of the ice.  Ice with no impurities is completely clear, however, ice can appear a number of different colours depending on its composition and how you are looking at it!</p>

In Antarctica, icebergs can be huge, for example iceberg “A-68” broke off the Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017, measuring ~160 kilometres long, covering an area approximately a quarter the size of Wales. </P>
                            <P>An important message this game aims to get across is that melting & iceberg calving are a normal part of an ice sheet that is in steady-state. Melting & icebergs become a source of concern when the amount of ice lost is greater than that going in, and the ice sheet becomes smaller and sea level rises.</P>
                            <P>If the ice front does not recover to its previous extent some time after the calving event, then it tells us that the ice front is retreating, and this is then when there is cause for concern.</p>

                            <p>In the interior of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, air temperatures are very cold, so a small amount of air temperature change will not significantly impact on the size of the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a> directly.  It is the indirect effects that cause big changes in the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>, such as changes in ocean circulation.</p>

                            <h5>Ocean Circulation:</h5>
                            <p>Ocean water around the planet varies in its temperature and saltiness (salinity).  This changes its density, which helps cause ocean currents to form.  When the water is dense it sinks, so these currents form at different levels in the ocean.  Wind blowing across the surface of the ocean also helps to drive ocean currents, and changes in the wind can modify ocean currents that will impact on marine <a href="#icesheets">ice sheets</a>.</p>
                            <p>At the edges of the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>, and under the <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a>, the water is very cold and fresh as it is formed from melting ice.  In the deeper ocean around Antarctica there is an ocean current called Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) which flows around the continent.  This water is a few degrees warmer than the melted-ice-water, so if it comes into contact with an <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a>, it will cause much higher melting of that <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a>.  Sometimes changing weather patterns cause wind directions and speeds to change, driving the water from the deep ocean to under the <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a>.  </p>
                            <p>A major impact of a warmer climate is a change in <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> conditions.  <a href="#icefloes">Sea ice</a> forms a barrier between the wind and the ocean surface, damping the effect of the wind on the ocean currents.  If the <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> is reduced, the wind may have more ability to cause warmer water to flow beneath the <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelves</a>.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Ice shelf collapse:</h5>
                            <p>While a small increase in air temperature will not have a big impact on the interior of the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>, it does affect more coastal areas at lower elevations.  The Antarctic Peninsula has seen some of the biggest rates of air temperature change in recent years, which has led to many <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelves</a> retreating and breaking up.  Most notably, the Larsen B Ice Shelf broke up in 2002 over the course of a few weeks, leading to the ice flowing into the <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a> speeding up.  It is thought that meltwater ponds which formed on the surface helped to cause such a catastrophic break up.</p>

As described above, the increase in water temperatures is triggered by changes in the whole climate system. </p>
                            <p>The complexity of ocean currents beneath the <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a> is also not represented in the game, this is a very complex system, and understanding the impact of changing <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a> and ocean conditions is very challenging.  </p>

                              <P>The entire Antarctic Ice Sheet contains enough water to raise sea level by 58 metres.  Much of this is in the larger “East Antarctic Ice Sheet”, where large parts of the bed are above sea level.  The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is a largely marine <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>, however, so is vulnerable to changes triggered by changes in ocean circulation.  If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to collapse it would raise sea level by about 3 metres.  One part of the ice sheet collapsing, could trigger another part by raising global sea level and causing extra flotation in other parts of the <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>.</P>
                              <P>The floating parts - <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelves</a> and <a href="#icebergs">icebergs</a> - have already displaced ocean water, so their melting doesn’t directly contribute to sea level rise.  The input of freshwater to the ocean does, however, change the ocean’s overall density – it has been calculated that if all the <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelves</a> of Antarctica melted, it could raise sea level by a 3-5 centimetres.  The Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelf contains about half of the <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a> volume in Antarctica, so could contribute a few centimetres to global sea level if it melted.</P>

                              <P>Sea level changes are not incorporated into the model, partly because, graphically, you wouldn’t see a few centimetres on the scale of the game domain.  Also, a flowline model makes it difficult to calculate the sea level contribution from one system retreating as we can’t incorporate the knock-on effects of changes in other <a href="#icestreams">ice streams</a>.</P>

                              <P>The game is called ice flows, a subtle play on words with the term “ice floes”.  Confusingly, an ice floe is a section of sea ice.  Sea ice is a different entity to glacial ice, being formed by frozen sea water.  Sea ice tends to be a few metres thick, floating on the ocean, and comes and goes with the seasons, though some survives from one year to the next.  Ice floes are not to be confused with <a href="#icebergs">icebergs</a> which have broken off an <a href="#icesheets">ice sheet</a>.</P>

                        <div class="row p-2">

                              <h4><i class="fas fa-flask"></i> Science</h4> 
                              <p>The role of penguins in the game is very much focussed around the game play, so should not be considered an accurate portrayal of how penguins behave and how they might be affected by changes in ice sheets!  See the fiction section below.  <p>
                                  Penguins are mainly affected by changes in <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> distribution, but can be affected by <a href="#icebergs">icebergs</a> which affect <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> distribution and block access to the water. 
                                  <h5>Penguins & sea ice:</h5>
                                  <p>Most Antarctic penguin species nest on rock, so losses of ice on land can create more breeding habitat. However, emperor penguins nest on fast ice (<a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> attached to land or <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelves</a>), and need this to be stable throughout the breeding season to raise chicks successfully. In some years ice breaks up earlier and all the chicks die.</p>
                                  <p>Penguins breathe air but feed in the water, so extensive ice can act as a barrier to foraging. If there is too much ice around the colony birds may have to walk for miles to the ice margin find food. Walking is slower than swimming, and this can mean chicks are fed less often and grow more slowly/starve when too much ice is around the colony.</p>
                                  <p>The prey species of penguins in the Antarctic include krill and icefish. These feed on algae and invertebrates under the <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a>, respectively, so a loss of <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> can mean less prey for penguins. Some <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> can also be useful to rest on whilst at sea (which saves energy) and to avoid predators (like leopard seals and killer whales). A mosaic of <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> around colonies is therefore optimal to provide access to water, abundant prey and platforms to rest on. The optimal amount of <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> varies among species: Ad&eacutelies and emperors like <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a>, chinstraps tolerate it while gentoos tend to avoid it.</p>
                                  <p>During winter, Ad&eacutelie penguins and emperor penguins feed on the ice edge. If this marginal ice zone moves south due to ice melting, the day length available to forage gets shorter, and as penguins mostly forage during the daytime this may makes it harder for them to balance their energy budgets.</p>
                                  <h5>Penguins & icebergs</h5>
                                  <p>Breaking up of <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelves</a> can produce colossal <a href="#icebergs">icebergs</a> that block penguins access to feeding areas, resulting in chick mortality and colony abandonment.</p>
                                  <h5>Penguins & Climate Change</h5>
                                  <p>Effects of climate on penguins are complicated and dependent on species and location. For example, Ad&eacutelie penguins are declining in the Western Antarctic Peninsula owing to loss of <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a>, whilst gentoos are increasing. In contrast in East Antarctica loss of ice on land and expansion of <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> (owing to reduced salinity from glacier melt, among other causes) is allowing Ad&eacutelie populations to increase and it remains too cold for gentoos to colonise.</p>
                                  <p>Long term projections suggest that Ad&eacutelie and emperor penguins will move south to colonise areas that were formerly too icy for them to inhabit. However, the continental landmass imposes limits on how far south they can move, with the Ross and Weddell Seas providing the most southerly possible refuge. Their former range to the north will become colonised by more sub-Antarctic species like chinstrap, gentoo and macaroni penguins. Nonetheless, detrimental effects of ice loss on prey abundance and daylight foraging opportunities during winter may result in net losses of penguin biomass across the continent.</p>

                              <h4><i class="fas fa-magic"></i> Fiction</h4>
                              <p>Most of the penguin behaviour in the game is based on fiction, in order to generate the game play.  Also, rainbow-penguins, dragon-penguins, dinosaur-penguins, unicorn-penguins and pheonix-penguins do not exist (say it quietly).  The only reality is that penguins eat fish, and leopard seals eat penguins.</p>
                              <p>Penguins do not tend to go too far inland on an ice sheet as they need to be close to the water to feed, so they are not found flowing along on top of ice sheets.</p>
                              <p>It is not the case that shrinking ice sheets are good for penguins because they can get to fish under the <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelf</a>. Fish are not generally found underneath <a href="#iceshelves">ice shelves</a>, the penguins in reality feed under the <a href="#icefloes">sea ice</a> (see Science section above). </p>

                    <p>Erebus the leopard seal is named after one of the ships, HMS Erebus, used in the expedition of James Clark Ross 
                      to Antarctica in 1839-1843. In Greek mythology, Erebus is a deity - the god of darkness - so best to steer 
                      clear of him! The other ship was called HMS Terror - can you find the character "Terror" in the game....?</p>

              Ice Flows is funded as part of a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) project led by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). The project aims to investigate what may happen in the near-future in the Weddell Sea region of Antarctica and the impact changes here could have on global sea-level.
              Research by Hartmut Hellmer and colleagues in 20121 showed that this part of Antarctica might be subject to warmer water coming into contact with the Filchner Ice Shelf, which could lead to significant retreat of this part of the ice sheet.

              <p>Research by Hartmut Hellmer and colleagues in 2012<sup>1</sup> showed that this part of Antarctica might be subject to warmer water coming into contact with the Filchner Ice Shelf, which could lead to significant retreat of this part of the ice sheet.</p>
              <p>The project combines fieldwork and computer modelling to investigate the relationships between changes in the atmosphere, the ocean and the ice sheet in this region.  The field campaign will collect data both to improve the way the models work, and also to test their results. </p>      
            </div>
            <div class="col text-justify">
              <p>Fieldwork is taking place over three years and includes: 1) hot water drilling through the ice shelf to make measurements of ocean properties beneath the ice shelf, 2) sediment coring to investigate past changes in the ice sheet, 3) radar and seismic measurements taken on the ice and from the air to measure ice thickness and basal topography.  Field parties are supported from the <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/rothera/">Rothera Research Station</a>, both in the air and via tractor-trains.</p>
              <p>Marine sediment cores and instrumented buoys, deployed from the RV Polarstern (<a href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/eisblog/2015/11/expeditions-filchner-endlich-gehts-los/">Alfred Wegener Institute</a>), will capture vital information from the Antarctic continental shelf and slope.</p>
              <p>State-of-the-art numerical models of the climate, ocean and ice sheets will then use the data collected to investigate how the ice sheet might behave in the future under different climate change scenarios.</p>
